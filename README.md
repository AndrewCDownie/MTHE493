To Do For Code:
Obstacle

RRT* 
-get the proper eta and RRT Gamma to work
-Find a way to get RRT star to run faster by reducing the access time to get nearest nodes
	-stop doing bru	te force
-Refactor to place the obstacles in a better way and make refactoring better
-comment the code more
-Create a way to save time by saving the cost at the node instead of staving cost at each location

FMT 
-implement primary code stucture
-implement

Main Application
-create a detect forign obstacle method?
-micro avoidance

-create a function to determine cost due to forign obstatle
-create a state for the enviroment for overal macrolevel code

Visualization
-Implment Cost Functions
-make work in seperate file
-create a proper read me
-create heat map
-robot driving visualization


Overal Project Tasks to DO
-Create a metric recording system to evalate the state of the stem	
-Create the moving object to test
-Create the overal system running file
-Make the visualization work with RRT and FMT
-possibliy make the classes make node for RRT and FMT -specifically and makesure the visualization works 
-click to location draw
