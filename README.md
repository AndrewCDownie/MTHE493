This is the Capstone Project for MTHE493. The project is an experimental Motion Planner for Stochastic Enviroments. The planner utilizes a Fast Marching Trees Algorithm with a cost-function dictated by a markov model of the enviroment to reroute a robot around unforseen obstacles and avoid them in the future.
