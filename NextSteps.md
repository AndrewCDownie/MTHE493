#next Steps for the project code

##step 1
Re factor the code for better understanding 
    * Make the enviroment class that is used to interact with the current enviroment, have things 
    such as the update and add new dection
    * refactor the path planning utils to make the code clearer
    * add proper agents as moving obstacles
    * add the agents as obstacles


##step 2
New research areas to look at
    * instead of using the classical decay switch it to increase the varience of the gausiass instead to redistinute the mass
    more relistically
    * add change the weighting based on a velocity to the infomation to the planner 
    * determine new ways to make the system run faster
